# Password-Generator
This Python code defines an abstract PasswordGenerator class and two implementations: PinGenerator creates numeric PINs of a specified length, while other generators can extend the base class to produce secure passwords using letters, digits, and symbols. It uses random for randomness and nltk for word support.
